### The following code organized the generated stimuli into spreadsheets for Gorilla Experiment Design.
1. Run the combine_excel.ipynb code to randomly select even number of male and female tasks. 
  - This code eliminate the gender as a varying dimension and gender will not be analyzed separatly
  - This code eliminate the total number of trials to reduce the experiment length.
2. Run the AP&SD_Section_spread_sheet_generation.ipynb to generate the spreadsheet of the formal P/A & S/D task.
3. Run the Instruction.ipynb to select and rename the wav files for instruction section in Gorilla, and generate the spreadsheets.
  - The sample instructions can be downloaded from the gorilla experiment (V4-**-Instruction)
4. Run the Practice.ipynb to select and rename the wav files for practice section in Gorilla, and generate the spreadsheets.
