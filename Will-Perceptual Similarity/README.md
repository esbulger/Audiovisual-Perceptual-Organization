# Perceptual Similarity Experiment (Gorilla spreadsheets generation)

This repository houses a suite of Jupyter notebooks designed for conducting perceptual similarity experiments across various auditory stimuli: complex tones, everyday sounds, and cat meows. Additionally, it includes utilities for generating experiment spreadsheets compatible with Gorilla, an online platform for running behavioral experiments.

### Notebooks Description

- `within_complexTone.ipynb`: Generates experiments and analyses for perceptual similarity within complex tones.
- `within_everydaySound.ipynb`: Focuses on experiments involving everyday sounds.
- `within_catMeow.ipynb`: Dedicated to experiments with cat meows.
- `perceptual-similarity1.ipynb`, `perceptual-similarity2.ipynb`, `perceptual-similarity3.ipynb`: These notebooks are tailored for specific categorical combination of the perceptual similarity study.

### Generating Gorilla-Compatible Spreadsheets

Each notebook contains specific sections dedicated to generating spreadsheets for uploading to Gorilla. Ensure you adjust the parameters according to your experiment requirements.
