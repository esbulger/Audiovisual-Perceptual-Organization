# Audiovisual-Perceptual_Organization

## Hypothesis
When listening to any sound, people estimate the source or sources that gave rise to it. This perceptual organization likely also shapes working memory, such that features of a single auditory object are automatically stored together. 

### Straightly speaking: 
- complex_tone------better S/D;  daily_sound -----better P/A (desired behavior)

### Challenge: 
The experiment stimuli are not consistent, because the everyday sound can be recalled multi-dimension; whereas tone is a single dimension

### Solution: 
Use a unitary sequence that includes both pitch and words/syllables to achieve consistency (version 2)

## Experiment design (version 2 & 3) and the questions it answers 

### S/D 
- Attend pitch: how does pitch (only pitch) affect the performance on this task-> focus on the pitch difference only
    - varying pitches | consistent words/syllables
    - Benefit: the sequence of the same words/syllables makes the pitches only variance.
- Attend words/syllables: how do words/syllables (only words/syllables) affect the performance on this task
    - varying words/syllables | consistent pitches
    - Benefit: the sequence of the same pitches makes the words/syllables only variance.

### P/A
- Attend pitch: How does pitch (only pitch) affect memory encoding and retrieving 
    - consistent words/syllables | P/A pitches
    - Solution: use P/A pitch but absent words/syllables to create a new pair (use the absent word to minimize the confusion (unproven))
        - Force the participants to focus and rely on the pitch for this task
        - Prevent the word to be used as a recall dimension
- Attend words/syllables: how do words/syllables (only words/syllables) affect the performance on this task
    - P/A words/syllables | consistent pitches
    - Solution: use P/A words/syllables but absent pitches to create a new pair 

## Experiment design (version 4) and the questions it answers 
In the experiment version 2 & 3, we run the stimuli with length 4, 6, 8, and the qprime of the pilot data is around 1 which is lower than we expected. This version of the experiment design aim to introduce 2 different version of the P/A and S/D task which non-attending dimension is fixed within every trial. 
- We are curious how much the performance could improve with extracting the information from the stimuli by keeping it constant/unchanged
