# Audiovisual-Perceptual_Organization

## Hypothesis
When listening to any sound, people estimate the source or sources that gave rise to it. This perceptual organization likely also shapes working memory, such that features of a single auditory object are automatically stored together. 

### Straightly speaking: 
- complex_tone------better S/D;  daily_sound -----better P/A (desired behavior)

### Challenge: 
The experiment stimuli are not consistent, because the everyday sound can be recalled multi-dimension; whereas tone is a single dimension

### Solution: 
Use a unitary sequence that includes both pitch and words/syllables to achieve consistency (version 2)

## Current experiment design (version 2) and the questions it answers 

### S/D 
- Attend pitch: how does pitch (only pitch) affect the performance on this task-> focus on the pitch difference only
    - same/diff pitches | same words/syllables
    - Good: the sequence of the same words/syllables makes the pitches only variance.
- Attend words/syllables: how do words/syllables (only words/syllables) affect the performance on this task
    - same/diff words/syllables |same pitches
    - Good: the sequence of the same pitches makes the words/syllables only variance.

### P/A
- Attend pitch: how does pitch (only pitch) affect the performance on this task ->
    - How does pitch (only pitch) affect memory encoding and retrieving
    - P/A pitches | same words/syllables
    - Challenge: subjects can convert to the same/different problem
        - Remembering the pitch/word as a pair, use the word as a source to determine whether this pair sounds the same or different
    - Answer: a pure short memory task on remembering #sound pair  (a word with its pitch)
        - Ex: 1 try your best to rely on the pitch  2. Try to use the word as information 
    - Solution: use P/A pitch but absent words/syllables to create a new pair (use the absent word to minimize the confusion (unproven))
        - Force the participants to focus and rely on the pitch for this task
        - Prevent the word to be used as a recall dimension
- Attend words/syllables: how do words/syllables (only words/syllables) affect the performance on this task
    - P/A words/syllables | same pitches
    - Challenge: 
        - subjects can convert to the same/different problem (less a problem)
        - Consistency of the experiment;    Since  P/A of attending to the pitch, we choose the different word and we should choose the absent pitch for the same reason; It would change the result much because the word is way easier to recall than the pitches.
    - Solution: use P/A words/syllables but absent pitches to create a new pair
