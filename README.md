# Audiovisual-Perceptual_Organization

## Hypothesis
When listening to any sound, people estimate the source or sources that gave rise to it. This perceptual organization likely also shapes working memory, such that features of a single auditory object are automatically stored together. 

### Straightly speaking: 
- complex_tone------better S/D;  daily_sound -----better P/A (desired behavior)

### Challenge: 
The experiment stimuli are not consistent, because the everyday sound can be recalled multi-dimension; whereas tone is a single dimension

### Solution: 
Use a unitary sequence that includes both pitch and words/syllables to achieve consistency (version 2)

## Experiment design (version 2 & 3) and the questions it answers 

### S/D 
- Attend pitch: how does pitch (only pitch) affect the performance on this task-> focus on the pitch difference only
    - varying pitches | consistent words/syllables
    - Benefit: the sequence of the same words/syllables makes the pitches only variance.
- Attend words/syllables: how do words/syllables (only words/syllables) affect the performance on this task
    - varying words/syllables | consistent pitches
    - Benefit: the sequence of the same pitches makes the words/syllables only variance.

### P/A
- Attend pitch: How does pitch (only pitch) affect memory encoding and retrieving 
    - consistent words/syllables | P/A pitches
    - Solution: use P/A pitch but absent words/syllables to create a new pair (use the absent word to minimize the confusion (unproven))
        - Force the participants to focus and rely on the pitch for this task
        - Prevent the word to be used as a recall dimension
- Attend words/syllables: how do words/syllables (only words/syllables) affect the performance on this task
    - P/A words/syllables | consistent pitches
    - Solution: use P/A words/syllables but absent pitches to create a new pair

## Experiment design (version 4) and the questions it answers

### S/D (Same/Different)
- **Attend perceptual similarity:** How does the perceptual similarity of sequence elements affect sequence order recognition?
    - Variables: Different sets of sounds (tones, everyday sounds, and cat meows), each presenting varying levels of perceptual similarity.
    - Rationale: To understand how perceptual similarity, as a variable, influences the ability to recognize sequence order. The inclusion of cat meows, a mid-level perceptual similarity sound set, aims to further dissect this relationship.


### P/A (Present/Absent)
- **Attend perceptual similarity:** How does the perceptual similarity between sounds affect the ability to identify individual items within sequences?
    - Variables: Use of tones, everyday sounds, and cat meows to test the impact of perceptual similarity on item identification.
    - Rational: Examining the influence of perceptual similarity on memory tasks, using sets of sounds that range from highly to moderately similar.

This design aims to delve deeper into how pitch and perceptual similarity independently influence auditory sequence memory and recognition, expanding on previous findings by introducing a novel sound set (cat meows).
