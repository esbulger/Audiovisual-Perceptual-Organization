# Project Versions Overview

This document provides an overview of the different versions of our project. Each version represents an iteration that includes new features, improvements, or changes in approach. The version numbers remain consistent across releases to maintain clarity and version control best practices.

## Version 1: Initial Release

- **File:** `will_version_1.ipynb`
- **Description:** The initial version lays the foundation for the project, establishing core functionalities and the basic framework upon which future iterations are built.

## Version 2: Second Dimension Randomization

- **File:** `will_version_2_2nd_dim_rand.ipynb`
- **Description:** Introduces randomization in the second dimension (pitch vs words/syllables).

## Version 2.5: Block-Based Randomization

- **File:** `will_version_2.5_blocked_based_rand.ipynb`
- **Description:** Refines the randomization approach by implementing block-based techniques, offering a more structured method of introducing randomness.

## Version 3: Second Dimension Fixed

- **File:** `will_version_3_2nd_dim_fixed.ipynb`
- **Description:** Shifts strategy by fixing the second dimension (pitch vs words/syllables), focusing on stabilizing certain aspects of the project to improve consistency.

## Version 3.5: Functionalization and Fixes

- **File:** `will_version_3.5_functionalized_fixed.ipynb`
- **Description:** Enhances the project's modularity and maintainability through functionalization, while also implementing crucial fixes to previous issues.

## Version 4: Perceptual Similarity

- **File:** `will_version_4_perceptual_similarity.ipynb`
- **Description:** Replicated the stimuli from this paper 'Perceptual organization and task demands jointly shape auditory working memory capacity', and can be used for various categories:complex tones, everyday sounds, and cat meows ...
