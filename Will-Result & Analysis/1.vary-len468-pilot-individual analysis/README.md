# Perceptual Organization Data Analysis

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks designed for the individual data analysis of perceptual organziation experiments. These notebooks are tailored for calculating correctness, d-prime scores, and other statistical measures for both AP (Absent/Present) and SD (Same/Different) tasks.


### Notebooks

- `AP_correctness_dprime.ipynb`: Analyzes data from AP tasks, calculating correctness and d-prime scores.
- `SD_correctness_dprime.ipynb`: Dedicated to SD tasks, this notebook calculates correctness and d-prime scores specific to these tasks.
- `correctness_dprime.ipynb`: A general-purpose notebook for calculating correctness and d-prime across different task types.
- `count.ipynb`: Counts occurrences and patterns within the dataset, useful for preliminary data exploration.
